Quite frankly, the Garmin Connect / Facebook interface for adding
stuff to Facebook through AddThis is total wankery, because it doesn't
even display an image.  I have no idea how AddThis works at all, so
I'm setting this shit up to try to figure that out, and then to see
whether I can easily make adding my runs to Facebook a bit better than
using Garmin Connect's interface.

Another option is to use MapMyRun's web site.  But it's also fucking
terrible.
